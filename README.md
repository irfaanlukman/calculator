DESCRIPTION:

In this distinct project, we are required to combine the fundamentals of Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a web-browser calculator application. It is an every day application involving intermediate concepts involving all 3 languages to further enhance knowledge and understanding.

What I learned:

1. Further understanding of logic flow in Javascript and had to think outsidethe box of functions required and possible problems faced in the fprocess of computation.

2. More practice with CSS grid layout and flex display.

3. More distinction between CSS classes and data types in HTML for JS and CSS callbacks between the two. 

4. Very confusing JS dom caching;  Need to improve on naming of functions and values.

5. Practiced converting number to strings and vice versa and knowing why it is required.

6. Overall good work on JS. Onwards and forwards!
